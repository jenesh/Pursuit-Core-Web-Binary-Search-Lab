# Binary Search Practice

## Exercises

1. Given a sorted array of numbers, find index of a target element within array in O(log(n)) time. Do not use recursion.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    binarySearch(arr, 2) // => 1
    ```

2. Given a sorted array of numbers, find index of a target element within array in O(log(n)) time. Use recursion.

    ```js
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    binarySearchRecursive(arr, 2) // => 1
    ```
